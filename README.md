# A-Bayesian-model-for-the-reconstruction-of-education--and-age-specific-fertility-rates-An-applicati
This repository includes codes and datasets used to reconstruct fertility rates by level of education.

We provide the input data to our Bayesian analysis as well as the R codes to replicate our results. We further add original estimates from "tfr2" module from STATA. We provide a sample code used for the extraction of "tfr2" estimates.
